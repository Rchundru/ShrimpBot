Currently it can play music, greet new members, flip a coin, quote the different ways you can cook shrimp\r from Forest Gump, keeps track of the number of times Shrimp has been said, roll dice, give a random quote said by a memeber in the server, and keeps track of the number of times lah700 has said smh.
